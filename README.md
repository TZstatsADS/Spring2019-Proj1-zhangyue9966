### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Data Story on Happy Moments Dataset
+ This project is conducted by Yue Zhang (*yz3383*)

+ Project summary: 

In this project, I analyzed the sentences from the Happy Moments, which contains 100535 records of happy moments sentences.
By using text mining, bigrams correlation, clustering, and sentiment analysis I explored some basic characters of these happy moments. Including the frequency of words, bigrams and the difference of these frequencies between people with different demographic backgrounds.
As a result,  several patterns and interesting clusters of their topics are identified in their happy moments' categories and words frequency, both common and different characteristics exist.
